### 3D printed parts

Note:  I work in imperial (I know, I'm the worst) so these files will show up tiny when you open them in cura.  Download the barbarian plugin in Cura to fix them.

* base1
	* This file is untested.  It was modified from the version I'm currently using to try and improve how the linear rod is gripped.
* base2
	* This file is untested.  It was modified from the version I'm currently using to try and improve how the linear rod is gripped.
* coupler
	* This couples the stepper motor to the leasd screw.  The stepper motor I bought came with a coupler for a different sized lead screw, I used the set screws that came with that coupler.
* nut carrier
	* The nut for the lead screw goes into this, and is attached to the bottom of the carriage.
* nut carrier block
	* This helps hold the lead screw nut into the nut carrier.
* carriage
* fixture plate
	* I designed this to be used for more than just keyboard switches.  This fixture allows you to attach things to hold parts you want to test.
* load cell base
* pusher
* scale holder
* scale reader holder
* switch holder
	* This will hold a switch without using the fixture plate.
* switch holder 2
	* This goes with the fixture plate.
