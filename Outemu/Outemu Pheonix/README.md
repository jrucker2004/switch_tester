This switch ended up being very inconsistent.  I initially thought there was something wrong wtih my test rig, but the results were similar over 10 tests runs.  The way this switch implements the click function results in the place the click happens to be different depending on how the internal parts are aligned while being depressed.  The release stroke is far more consistent, however.  While investigating, if I applied pressure towards the back of the switch while depressing, the cilck happened much sooner in the stroke than if I was applying pressure towards the front of the switch.  As a result, the "Average" graph doesn't show a true representation of what this switch feels like.
